Hello! This is a small project on which I am working. Syntax is explained in 'manual' file :)
Project goal is to make a compiled programming language with syntax amid c and assembly.
For compiling your code you need to open .c file and run it in the same directory as .txt file ( otherwise you will need to write path as an input in .exe file(compiled .c file))
