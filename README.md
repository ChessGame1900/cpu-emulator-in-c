Hello! This is a small project on which I am working. Project idea is to create a compiled to assembly programming languge and file manager for it :) <br />
For compiling to assembly your code you need to run emulator.c file using c compiler or emulator.exe. But it you want to run got assembly you can run yourself using nasm x86 assembly or directly run in file manager using "run" command :)<br />
In the manual file syntax is explained. <br />

`` <br />
section .data<br />
char hello[] = "Hello World!"<br />
void helloWorld(){<br />
write hello<br />
}<br />
``<br />
result: Hello World!<br />

good luck :) with best wishes and hugs :)
