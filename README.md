Hello! <br />
This is a small project on which I am working. Project idea is to create a compiled to assembly programming languge and file manager for it :) <br />
For compiling to assembly your code you need to run emulator.c file using c compiler or emulator.exe. But it you want to run got assembly you can run yourself using nasm x86 assembly or directly run in file manager using "run" command :)<br />
In the manual file syntax is explained. <br />

`` 
section .data
char hello[] = "Hello World!"
void helloWorld()
write hello
}
``
result: Hello World <br />

good luck :) with best wishes and hugs :)
