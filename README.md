Hello! This is a small project on which I am working.

For creating varible you need to declare : register dataType value
Register can be named as register and number ( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A).
DataType can be int or char( later will be implemented more dataTypes)) ( value can be string or
integer( later will be added more variants like true or false, imaginary numbers, numbers with floating point ext.))
For printing in console: write register
for getting input from user: read register
Register as register and number( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A)) ( you don't need to worry about dataType, code analyze and use needed)
For if and for you can use ==, !=,>,<,>=,<=( == compare if arguments are equal, != compare if arguments are not equal, > and < as in mathematics compare first with second argument, >= and <= compare if first or second arguments is greater or euqal)
For declaring array you need write : dataType name[variableAmountLimit]= var, var, var
(dataTypa can ba int or char( later will be other types), name can be any string, variableAmountLimit is variable amount limit :), var can be any value or variable)
