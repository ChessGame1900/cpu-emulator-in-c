Hello!
This is a small project on which I am working. The project idea is to create a compiler to assembly programming language and a file manager for it! ðŸ˜Š

Features
Compile your code to assembly using the emulator.c file or the precompiled emulator.exe.
For running the generated assembly, you can:
Use nasm for x86 assembly.
Directly execute it using the file manager with the run command.
Usage
Refer to the manual file for syntax explanation. Here's an example of the syntax used in this project:

Assembly
section .data
char hello[] = "Hello World!"

void helloWorld() {
    write hello
}
Result:

Code
Hello World
Getting Started
Compile the emulator.c file using any C compiler or use the emulator.exe provided in the project.
Write your code in the specified syntax.
Compile it to assembly using the emulator.
Run the resulting assembly code using nasm or the built-in file manager.
Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
With best wishes and hugs! ðŸ¤—
