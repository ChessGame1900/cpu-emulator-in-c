Hello!
This is manual manual for this small project.
For creating varible you need to declare : register dataType value
Register can be named as register and number ( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A).
DataType can be int or char( later will be implemented more dataTypes)) ( value can be string or
integer( later will be added more variants like true or false, imaginary numbers, numbers with floating point ext.))

For printing in console: write register
for getting input from user: read register

Register as register and number( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A)) ( you don't need to worry about dataType, code analyze and use needed)

For if and for you can use ==, !=,>,<,>=,<=( == compare if arguments are equal, != compare if arguments are not equal, > and < as in mathematics compare first with second argument, >= and <= compare if first or second arguments is greater or euqal)
