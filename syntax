for creating varible you need to declare : register dataType value
(register can be named as register and number ( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A) ( removed hexadecimal for not a long time. Work in progress)) ( dataType can be int or char( later will be implemented more dataTypes)) ( value can be string or
integer( later will be added more variants like true or false, imaginary numbers, numbers with floating point ext.)) 

for printing in console: write register
(register as register and number( as example register1) or hexadecimal( 0x000A)) ( you don't need to worry about dataType, code analyze and use needed)

for getting input from user: read register
(will be added later)
